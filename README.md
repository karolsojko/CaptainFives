### How it works

When added to a channel, the Captain silently keeps track of every /five given to users.
To retrieve the /five count for the users just mention @captainfives along with any user(s) you want to retrieve data for.

### TODO / Ideas

- Display Top 5 and Top 10 users.
- Set /fives milestones and automatically congratulate users when their /fives count pass them.
- Expose data over API.
